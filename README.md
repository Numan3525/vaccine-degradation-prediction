# vaccine-degradation-prediction
In this competition, we are looking to leverage the data science expertise of the Kaggle community to develop models and design rules for RNA degradation. Your model will predict likely degradation rates at each base of an RNA molecule, trained on a subset of an Eterna dataset comprising over 3000 RNA molecules (which span a panoply of sequences and structures) and their degradation rates at each position. We will then score your models on a second generation of RNA sequences that have just been devised by Eterna players for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. These final test sequences are currently being synthesized and experimentally characterized at Stanford University in parallel to your modeling efforts -- Nature will score your models!  Improving the stability of mRNA vaccines was a problem that was being explored before the pandemic but was expected to take many years to solve. Now, we must solve this deep scientific challenge in months, if not weeks, to accelerate mRNA vaccine research and deliver a refrigerator-stable vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19. The problem we are trying to solve has eluded academic labs, industry R&amp;D groups, and supercomputers, and so we are turning to you. To help, you can join the team of video game players,
