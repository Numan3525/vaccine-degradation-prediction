Weh have 2.5GB data for this competion. The data is available on the competition website at https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine/data

There are multiple ground truth values provided in the training data. While the submission format requires all 5 to be predicted, only the following are scored: reactivity, deg_Mg_pH10, and deg_Mg_50C.

Files
train.json - the training data
test.json - the test set, without any columns associated with the ground truth.
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
Columns
id - An arbitrary identifier for each sample.
seq_scored - (68 in Train and Public Test, 91 in Private Test) Integer value denoting the number of positions used in scoring with predicted values. This should match the length of reactivity, deg_* and *_error_* columns. Note that molecules used for the Private Test will be longer than those in the Train and Public Test data, so the size of this vector will be different.
seq_length - (107 in Train and Public Test, 130 in Private Test) Integer values, denotes the length of sequence. Note that molecules used for the Private Test will be longer than those in the Train and Public Test data, so the size of this vector will be different.
sequence - (1x107 string in Train and Public Test, 130 in Private Test) Describes the RNA sequence, a combination of A, G, U, and C for each sample. Should be 107 characters long, and the first 68 bases should correspond to the 68 positions specified in seq_scored (note: indexed starting at 0).
structure - (1x107 string in Train and Public Test, 130 in Private Test) An array of (, ), and . characters that describe whether a base is estimated to be paired or unpaired. Paired bases are denoted by opening and closing parentheses e.g. (....) means that base 0 is paired to base 5, and bases 1-4 are unpaired.
reactivity - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as seq_scored. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in sequence, and used to determine the likely secondary structure of the RNA sample.
deg_pH10 - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as seq_scored. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in sequence, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base/linkage after incubating without magnesium at high pH (pH 10).
deg_Mg_pH10 - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as seq_scored. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in sequence, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base/linkage after incubating with magnesium in high pH (pH 10).
deg_50C - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as seq_scored. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in sequence, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base/linkage after incubating without magnesium at high temperature (50 degrees Celsius).
deg_Mg_50C - (1x68 vector in Train and Public Test, 1x91 in Private Test) An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as seq_scored. These numbers are reactivity values for the first 68 bases as denoted in sequence, and used to determine the likelihood of degradation at the base/linkage after incubating with magnesium at high temperature (50 degrees Celsius).
*_error_* - An array of floating point numbers, should have the same length as the corresponding reactivity or deg_* columns, calculated errors in experimental values obtained in reactivity and deg_* columns.
predicted_loop_type - (1x107 string) Describes the structural context (also referred to as 'loop type')of each character in sequence. Loop types assigned by bpRNA from Vienna RNAfold 2 structure. From the bpRNA_documentation: S: paired "Stem" M: Multiloop I: Internal loop B: Bulge H: Hairpin loop E: dangling End X: eXternal loop
S/N filter Indicates if the sample passed filters described below in Additional Notes.
